                    This project focuses on collecting recyclable materials, such as plastics and glass, from markets and households. 
                    Our goal is to **reduce waste sent to landfills** by recycling these materials and turning them into useful products. 
                    We also organize upcycling workshops where participants learn to transform discarded items into valuable products, 
                    such as eco-bricks, flower pots, and reusable bags.
