            <h2>Environmental Impacts</h2>
            <p>
                Over the years, Wahapahapa Waste Management has made significant strides in cleaning and preserving the environment across local communities. Our efforts have helped reduce waste accumulation in public spaces, improved the health and safety of residents, and promoted eco-friendly practices. These impacts include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Reduction of Plastic Waste:</b> We have reduced plastic waste in local markets by over 30% through public education and clean-up campaigns.</li>
                <li><b>Improved Waste Segregation:</b> Communities are now practicing waste segregation, resulting in increased recycling rates and reduced landfill usage.</li>
                <li><b>Cleaner Waterways:</b> Regular clean-ups along rivers and streams have improved water quality, benefitting local wildlife and reducing water-borne diseases.</li>
                <li><b>Climate Change Mitigation:</b> By reducing waste burning and promoting proper waste disposal, we have contributed to lowering local carbon emissions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Our dedication to maintaining a clean environment has had a ripple effect, encouraging local businesses, schools, and institutions to adopt sustainable waste management practices.</p>
