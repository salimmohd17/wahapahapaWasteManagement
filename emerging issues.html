      <h2>Tackling Key Environmental Challenges in Our Communities</h2>
      <p>At Wahapahapa Waste Management, we are committed to solving real waste management challenges affecting our towns and coastlines. Here are the six major issues we are addressing to create cleaner, greener, and healthier environments.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section class="content container">

    <!-- 1. Garbage Collection -->
    <div class="issue-block">
      <img src="images/garbage-collection.jpg" alt="Garbage Collection" class="issue-img">
      <div class="issue-text">
        <h3>1. Garbage Collection</h3>
        <p>
          Uncollected waste leads to blocked drainages, unpleasant odors, and health risks for communities. Wahapahapa ensures daily and consistent garbage collection from residential areas, markets, and roadsides. 
          We work closely with local authorities and bodaboda riders to improve waste transport logistics, ensuring that every household and business benefits from timely and responsible waste disposal.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- 2. Plastic Management -->
    <div class="issue-block">
      <img src="images/plastic-management.jpg" alt="Plastic Management" class="issue-img">
      <div class="issue-text">
        <h3>2. Plastic Management</h3>
        <p>
          Plastic waste, especially single-use plastics, poses a severe threat to our land and marine environments. 
          Our plastic management initiative involves collecting, sorting, and repurposing plastics into useful products such as baskets, aprons, and handbags. 
          Through awareness campaigns and collaborations with recyclers, we promote responsible plastic disposal and recycling.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- 3. Town Cleanups -->
    <div class="issue-block">
      <img src="images/town-cleanups.jpg" alt="Town Cleanups" class="issue-img">
      <div class="issue-text">
        <h3>3. Town Cleanups</h3>
        <p>
          Every weekday, our teams organize structured town cleanup exercises that bring together youth groups, bodaboda riders, and local traders. 
          These cleanups help restore order, beauty, and sanitation to towns around the Diani manucipality. 
          Fridays feature joint inter-town cleanups, fostering collaboration and environmental pride across communities.
        </p>

    <!-- 4. Household Waste Management -->
    <div class="issue-block">
      <img src="images/household-management.jpg" alt="Household Waste Management" class="issue-img">
      <div class="issue-text">
        <h3>4. Household Waste Management</h3>
        <p>
          Many households lack proper systems for waste sorting and storage. We educate residents on how to separate organic and non-organic waste, store waste safely, and reduce waste generation at the source. 
          This approach makes our collection process more efficient and promotes sustainable waste habits at the household level.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- 5. Community Engagement -->
    <div class="issue-block">
      <img src="images/community-engagement.jpg" alt="Community Engagement" class="issue-img">
      <div class="issue-text">
        <h3>5. Community Engagement</h3>
        <p>
          Our work is people-driven. We involve community members in every step — from cleanups to awareness campaigns and environmental competitions. 
          We empower youth and women through environmental entrepreneurship, offering opportunities in recycling, waste collection, and public awareness initiatives.

    <!-- 6. Beach Cleanups -->
    <div class="issue-block">
      <img src="images/beach-cleanup.jpg" alt="Beach Cleanups" class="issue-img">
      <div class="issue-text">
        <h3>6. Beach Cleanups</h3>
        <p>
          The coastal ecosystem is vital to our livelihoods, yet pollution from plastics and waste threatens its beauty and biodiversity. 
          Our beach cleanup campaigns unite volunteers, fishermen, students, and tourists to clean shorelines, reduce marine litter, and raise awareness on ocean protection. 
          These efforts contribute directly to cleaner, safer beaches and a thriving blue economy.
