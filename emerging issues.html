            <h2>Addressing New Challenges in Waste Management</h2>
            <p>With the rapid increase in waste generation, here are the key emerging issues we face today.</p>

            <h3>1. Plastic Pollution</h3>
            <p>Plastic waste continues to be a major environmental issue, with the rise of single-use plastics and packaging. Despite efforts in recycling, a large portion of plastic still ends up in landfills or oceans, causing significant ecological harm. Innovations in biodegradable plastics and stricter regulations are essential.</p>

            <h3>2. E-Waste Management</h3>
            <p>Electronic waste is growing at an unprecedented rate due to the rapid development of new technologies. Old phones, computers, and appliances are often improperly disposed of, leading to the release of harmful chemicals into the environment. Proper e-waste recycling infrastructure is crucial to handle this challenge.</p>

            <h3>3. Waste-to-Energy Initiatives</h3>
            <p>The concept of converting waste into energy is gaining traction globally. However, there are concerns regarding the environmental impact of such facilities, particularly in relation to emissions. Balancing energy recovery with environmental sustainability is a key issue in waste-to-energy initiatives.</p>

            <h3>4. Urbanization and Waste Generation</h3>
            <p>Rapid urbanization has led to a sharp increase in the amount of waste generated by cities. Managing urban waste efficiently requires new technologies, public awareness, and policies to reduce, reuse, and recycle waste.</p>

            <h3>5. Food Waste</h3>
            <p>Approximately one-third of all food produced globally is wasted. This waste has far-reaching environmental impacts, including unnecessary use of water and land resources. Initiatives to reduce food waste through smarter consumption and distribution practices are increasingly critical.</p>
